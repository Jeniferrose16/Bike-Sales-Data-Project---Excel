# Bike-Sales-Data-Project---Excel
This beginner project consisted of cleaning and normalizing data using Microsoft Excel.  Once the data was cleaned, I created a dashboard using Microsoft Excel.

Initial data used for this project can be found at https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Excel-Tutorial/blob/b80a3c4f971a1608f2593ad8a585b53fbe74435e/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx.
